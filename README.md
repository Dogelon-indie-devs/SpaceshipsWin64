## Spaceships, the game ##
Somewhat stable Win64 desktop version of the game, not regularly updated. When we have a new feature we would like people to see and give feedback on, the exe is updated. Kinda like an open alpha, but without any promotion, quietly building till we have something cool to show.

## Ship Editor ##
Stand-alone (for now) exe containing all the tools necessary to design a ship. The best designs will make it into the game. Once launched, the ship NFTs will make it possible to own your own ship based on one of these designs.

### Shipdesign tutorial: ###
* (optional) check the editor [source code](https://github.com/Dogelon-indie-devs/Spaceships-editor "Github") to make sure there's no evil stuff 
* download the compiled ShipEditor.exe from here
* (optional) safety first! run a virus scan on the downloaded file
* start the editor
* generate a new grid, keeping in mind this will be the maximum boundary that you have to fit everything in
* sign your name as author
* pick a cool name for the ship class (animal names work great and will likely be used in game)
* pick some pretty hull block color
* place blocks in some awesome design, add interior floors, glass windows, doors/airlocks...
* click Save design button to export as json
* make a screenshot of your creation
* upload the .shipdesign file together with a screenshot to the internet (tag us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dogelon_dev "Twitter") or upload it directly to [gamedev discord channels](https://discord.com/invite/dQWgmP8kan "Discord")  )
* (possibly) be proud when you see the design picked for integration
